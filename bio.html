	<h1>About Me</h1>

	<p class="maintext">Robert Chin is a Sophomore majoring in Computer Science at Tufts University. Born in Boston, he grew up in Norwell, MA, a quiet suburb of about 10,000 residents. </p>

	<p class="maintext">From a young age, his immigrant mother helped foster his academic dilligence and intellectual curiosity through her active engagement with his learning. His interest in Computer Science comes from his early fascination with how computers operate and his love for video games.</p> 

	<p class="maintext">In his free time, Rob enjoys practicing archery (which he has been doing for over a decade!), snapping photos of flowers, listening to music, and watching movies with friends!</p>
